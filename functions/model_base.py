        '''
        Write a function that accepts strategy distribution and returns payoff.  Ensure the game_pars 
        dictionary has all the parameters it needs.

        Inputs:
        ---

        strats, list of str:
            A list of the strategy names in the same order as strat_counts.  Index 0 in strats is 
            treated as the focal strategy.

        strat_counts:
            How many individuals in the group are pursuing which strategies.  For example, if 
            strats = ['C', 'D', 'P'] and strat_counts = [2, 1, 3], then the group has 2 
            cooperators, 1 defector, and 3 punishers.

        Outputs:
        ---

        payoff, float
            Payoff to and individual playing the focal strategy (strats[0], cooperators in example 
            above) given the distribution of strategies in strat_counts.
